					<h1><span>Weaving Healthy Behaviors into New Technology Routines: Designing in (and for) the COVID-19 Work-from-Home Period</span></h1>
					<h4><span>3 hours | online | 20th July - 26th July (tbd)</span></h4>
					</div>
					<p><br>Sitting in front of computers has become a major part of our workaday routines, challenging us in maintaining active and healthy lifestyles. This challenge becomes even more salient during this worldwide work-from-home period due to COVID-19. While a large variety of existing interactive systems have been developed to facilitate health tracking and healthy exercises, relatively little research concerns incorporating healthy behaviors as HCI elements in daily routines.</p>
					<p>To maximize pervasive health benefits in users’ technology routines, this workshop sets out to explore a design paradigm that enables users to use lightweight, healthy behaviors to perform daily interactions with computing systems. To navigate this new design space, this workshop calls for interdisciplinary endeavors, synergizing expertise from HCI design, health informatics, persuasive technology, exertion game, and psychology.</p>

					<h4 id="cfp-info">Call for Papers</h4>
					<p>We propose a promising but underexplored opportunity for HCI design — to promote micro health interventions by integrating them into users’ everyday tasks with technology devices without disrupting users’ ongoing routines (namely: <i>healthful routine technologies</i> (<b>HRTs</b>)). One simple example could be enabling users to perform healthy behavors such as bodily exertion or deep breathing, as a means to interact with technologies, while they are already engaged in some primary activities with those technologies (e.g., working in front of your computer). As such, we aim at confering micro health gains without disrupting ongoing technology-assisted activities.</p>
					<p>To navigate this new design space, this workshop calls for interdisciplinary endeavors, synergizing expertise from HCI design, health informatics, persuasive technology, exertion game, and psychology. We invite submissions of research position papers or intervention/design proposals: <b>2-4 pages in <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF" target="_blank">CHI Extended Abstracts format</a>.</b> We welcome contributions related (but not limited) to the following aspects </p>
					<p><br><i>- Novel healthful interactions, e.g., peripheral interaction, exertion games, playful interaction, embodied tangible interaction, etc.</i></p>
					<p><i>- Understand users and/or contexts for designing health-promoting technologies.</i></p>
					<p><i>- Behavior change technologies, e.g., persuasive strategies, nudging, social influences, etc.</i></p>
					<p><i>- Psychological and/or physiological research for improving health behaviors</i></p>
					<p><i>- Personal informatics for supporting healthy lifestyles.</i></p>
					<p><i>- Other research explorations that are relevant to this topic</i></p>
					<p><br>All the submissions will be peer-reviewed by our interdisciplinary review committee. The accepted papers are eligible to submit an extended verion in a special edition of a journal (TBC).</p>
					<p><b>Important Dates</b></p>
					<p>- Deadline for submissions: <b>03 Jul 2020</b></p>
					<p>- Notification to workshop participants: <b>10 Jul 2020</b></p>
					<p>Submission should be sent to: <b><a href="mailto:x.ren@tue.nl">x.ren[at]tue[dot]nl</a></b> or <b><a href="mailto:p.an@tue.nl">p.an[at]tue[dot]nl</a></b>.</p>

								<p><i>Breathe-In: deep breathing as a daily HCI technique</i><br>Breathe-In is an exploration of employing deep breathing behaviors in the use of digital devices in daily routines. Derived from a breathing training method, the designed interaction technique asks users to inhale deeply and hold the breath for a few seconds. As such, this interaction can be easily distinguished by the system from the regular breathing behaviors of users, and then trigger customized functions that are meaningful to users in their primary activity (working, reading, or driving). For example: turning the page on an e-reader, switching a song in Spotify, or listening to a message just received by phone.</p>

								<p><i>LightSit: Activating Sedentary Office Routines</i><br>LightSit is a health-promoting system to provide office workers with an unobtrusive health intervention and support at-the- desk microbreaks that can be interwoven into a work routine. LightSit consists of a sensor mat that can be embedded into an office chair for measuring a user’s sitting posture and heart rate variability and a lighting display that is integrated into a monitor stand to present information unobtrusively, facilitating fitness and relaxation exercises during microbreaks. The user study of LightSit suggests that the system has the potential to prompt and facilitate small bouts of desk-based healthful activities with relatively low effort without overburdening office work. Besides, integrating sensing and feedback into a workstation made LightSit unobtrusive, and compatible with workflow.</p>
