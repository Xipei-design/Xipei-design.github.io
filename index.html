					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>Hello, I am Xipei. As a design researcher with a background in industrial design, I am interested in exploring new forms of intelligent product service systems in relation to health promotion, human vitality, and healthcare provision. </p>
					<p>Currently, I am <a href="https://design.bit.edu.cn/sz2/szdw/580e5aa7be1246c1981b02197f9452d6.htm" target="_blank">associate professor and PhD promoter</a> at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). Besides, I also work as the principle investigator of the Healthful Experience Design (HxD) research group, the vice director of the BIT-International Design Center, as well as the vice director of the interaction design and social innovation key lab at BIT.  Additionally, I am appointed as a <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/xipei-ren" target="_blank">guest researcher and a PhD advisor</a> at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). Previously, I was a postdoc researcher of Vitality Data Centre at TU/e. Apart from my postdoctoral fellowship, I also worked as UX researcher in the AI and Data Science team at HumanTotalCare, the largest occulational health service provider in the Netherlands. </p>
					<p>I received a <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/work-or-workout-designing-interactive-technology-for-workplace-fi" target="_blank">Ph.D.</a> degree also from the Industrial Design department at TU/e, under the supervison of <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/yuan-lu/" target="_blank">Dr.Yuan Lu</a> and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/aarnout-brombacher/" target="_blank">Prof.dr.Aarnout Brombacher</a>. I regularly publish scientific papers in international journals and conferences in the field of human-computer interaction or digital health, and presents research projects in design exhibitions globally. I coach students at BIT and TU/e and many more design institutions on design and research projects at batchelor, master, and Ph.D. levels. I sometimes travel to universities and research institutions in China and Europe to give lectures.</p>
					<p>My research often conducts in collaborative settings with partners from academia and industry. I take qualitative inquiry and participatory design to understand users and contexts and derive design requirements for health technology; I follow iterative design processes to develop concepts, mockups, and functional prototypes; I use quantitative and qualitative evaluations to study the meaning of novel designs to people's life and measure their impacts on health, well-being, and beyond. </p>
